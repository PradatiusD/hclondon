<h3>The color rules</h3>

<strong>Think skin tone</strong>
If you want a natural looking finish, then you will need to consider your skin tone. As a general rule, cool skin tones suit base colors with blue and purple hues, whereas warm skin tones benefit from orange and red undertones.  These colors should form the base of any color you would like to add to your hair.

<strong>Light and natural</strong> 
If you are after a shade that enhances what you already have or returns your hair to its natural tone, then highlights for blonds and a demi-permanent color for brunettes may be the perfect answer.  Both options add shine.

<strong>Solid and shiny</strong> 
Some color treatments thicken the hair strand.  With this in mind, if you are after a shade that makes your hair shiny and healthy then an all over demi-permanent may be the answer.  In general demi-permanents are less damaging than permanent colors.

<strong>Do you want to whisper, shout or scream about your color?</strong>
When coloring your hair, you must consider your personality and ask your stylist to help you choose the best suitable result according to how far you want to push the change.  If you are keen on looking for a subtle change, extremely contrasting tones of reds, pinks or blues will leave you a little dissatisfied.  Different techniques used for different effects can also determine your intensions and your colorist will choose the best option, when you discuss your desires in color department.
