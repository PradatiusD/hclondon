Whatever the hue, make it vibrant and vivacious!

With the new Ombre color trend, I want to excite and inspire you to be more creative with your color in the next few months.

Whether it is commercially subtle or creatively full-on, Ombre look achieves a variety of results providing opportunities to embrace a wide range of possibilities. While trends come and go, Ombre technique excites me with its potential for long term appeal. Whether with the help of permanent color or use of extensions, this technique inspires stylists to be creative to offer the individual client choices. The results can range from delicate and muted to fierce and funky, allowing Ombre, to be wearable, fascinating and fun.

It is of course, important for the colorist to analyze the natural color, texture of the hair assessing the integrity as well as the previous treatments. It is often possible to drain the color from the background when working on virgin hair, whilst previously colored hair will oppose to this treatment and may give unexpected results. This is a perfect reason when extensions are the only way to go. Creative coloring is not only used with Ombre technique, but can be used as accents for temporary high or low lights, for emphasizing height, reducing volume even helping a low hairline to recede. We can even get jolly creative with Blond on Blond results by using various levels of lighter shades. So you see, there are no boundaries when we want to be creative, as long as we remember the trilogy of good hair. Color, condition and cut must always support each other to remain on the road of success when it comes to fabulous hair.

For a more sultry look, another option can be ultra-feminine, powerfully seductive, but never too obvious peekaboo fringes on glossy, rich color combined with sleek precision bobs. We saw clean lines, neon colors and hi-tech fabrics on the runways throughout the first few months of the year. Top stylists and hair designers also seized this feeling and created clean, powerful and minimalistic looks that seemed to shimmer with vitality. There has never been a better time than now to re-evaluate your hair and seek professional advice on how far you can stretch your desires and what seemed the unreal and unlikely on the style front, is now a few hours in a salon away. My sincerest wishes for all my clients, when it comes to changing a hair style, comes with my deepest empathy, but I urge them all by saying “if nothing changes, nothing changes!”, no matter how small a change to update your look, a change is a must at least once a year. My question to you next, is “when was your last style or color change?”
