<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;line-height: 115%">It was another beautiful sunny morning in Weston Town Center and a young lady walked through the front door of the salon.She looked lost and worried and was clearly looking for advice.What transpired was more than I imagined.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 115%">Melanie arrived in the salon with her beautiful smile, but somewhat worried look on her face. As it is customary, front desk asked me to spare some time for a consultation to understand her needs. At the beginning of her conversation, Melanie was hesitant to explain that, what really bothered her was the unruly hair she ended up with since the last time she had a haircut. She said it was what she asked for and could not understand why her hair was so unmanageable all of a sudden, after taking 4 or 5 inches off her length.. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 115%">“Short hair is always what I wanted she said”,forgetting the true nature of her hair.Although very straight when long, a few inches off the length, would remove the weight which was controlling her curls. So when considering a change of style, it is very important to consider the texture of the hair.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 115%">“Is there anything that can be done?” she asked with the same familiar worried look.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 115%">I recommended a Keratin smoothing treatment. She was concerned to go down this route as she heard that Keratin could be harmful, damaging, expensive and time consuming. Of course, I assured her that none of these applied. The harmful effect of keratin stems from the fumes which some products with very high formaldehyde have, our product is in gel form and is absorbed into the hair without any fumes during the sealing stage. The damage only occurs if the wrong heat and incorrect action is applied on the hair. The price of this treatment can be from $100 and it lasts 5 months. When one considers the ease of styling, this seems a little price to pay.As far as the time it takes, trust me, it is no longer than a blow dry with a flat iron service.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 115%">This is when I feel lucky that I was granted the wonderful ‘healing power with hair’.What happened next was a turning point in her life with Melanie. A month later, Melanie wrote:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 115%">“Helen, thank you for your help in sorting out my hair.I have received so many compliments in the last few weeks,that I feel I gained the confidence I lacked in my teenage years. For my 20<sup>th</sup> birthday, I decided to go back to school to further my education and you will be invited to my graduation at the end of 4 years it will take to get my qualification.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;line-height: 115%">Wow…..what a joy it is to make a difference in someone’s life.</span></p>
